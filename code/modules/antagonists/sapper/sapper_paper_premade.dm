Remember employee,

<br>The work-day starts with preparation, you're currently in deep-space nearby a Port Authority researching outpost, <b>once you enter their sector there is no turning back.</b> Before you set sail a small check-list should be completed:
<br>1. Meet with your partner and decide who wears which mask.
2. Sort out your equipment, including the contents of the lockers and crates.
3. Fill and link the portable ore-silo and flat-pack fabricator.
4. Wrench the air tank on its north side to attach it to the air distribution pipeline.
5. Prepare the PACMAN and SMES according to your shuttle's powerdraw (5kw).

Completed that list? Great, then its time for breakfast and formulating a gameplan. There are many ways to tackle the work-day, and each has their own level of threat and heat it brings.
You may greatly post-pone your credit-miner's activation to build a secure and remote environment for it to work in. Working sloppily and hastefully is not ideal, our material is too expensive and fragile.
In some cases it may even be wise to completely leave the shuttle for a better suited environment to protect the credit-miner; remember that it works in space and doing so will avoid <i>external</i> heating complications.
<i>internal</i> only cools over-time while the machine is detached or not running, stay nearby so you can keep proper control of its temperature!

If you and your partner <i>do decide</i> to outpost inside the shuttle, <b>make sure that you have control of the temperature.</b> Space-coolers are incredibly power inefficient,
and you may leave your shuttle completely uninhabitable!
<br>Remember to make use of your portable turrets <i>and</i> shuttle turrets, but expect retaliation when you do; <i>they do not have a safe-mode!</i>
<br>
Have a good day at work.

IMPORTANT, make sure to understand the following:

<br>While this machine may work wonders, it is an incredibly volatile piece of technology. The more power it converts, the hotter it gets; makes sense right?
You may be considering plugging it straight into an engine, which is a great strategy to a successful day at work; <i>if</i> you are prepared to siphon such large pulses of energy.
Temperature control is key, both in the work environment and of the miner's hardware. Set up space-coolers and <b>don't leave the miner unattended for a long time!</b>

What happens if you or your partner forget to manage the temperature? Besides the catastrophic consequence of blowing a giant crater into Port Authority assets, the significant loss of profits, or the very likely odds of employee casualty, it <i>isn't</i> the end of the work day.

A truly committed sapper can continue by re-building the credit-miner, the knowledge of doing so being a data-fragment uploaded into the mind of each employee.
Don't get to celebrating just yet, though. The recipe to crafting the machine is complex, and after what you've likely caused to nearby civilization; these materials won't be easy to come by.
<br>
But you're not going to return empty-handed, <i>right?</i>
