changes:
  - rscadd: "Languages can now have partial understanding of other languages. More common English words are more likely to be mutually understood."
  - rscadd: "Those who understand Beachtongue can understand 50% of Common and 33% of Uncommon words."
  - rscadd: "Those who understand Common can understand 33% of Beachtongue and 20% of Uncommon words."
  - rscadd: "Those who understand Uncommon can understand 20% of Common and 20% of Beachtongue words."
  - rscadd: "Bilingual quirk: You can now choose between being able to speak or not speak the language"
  - rscadd: "Bilingual quirk: You can now choose to have partial understanding of your language, rather than full."
  - qol: "If you speak in ALL CAPS in a foreign language, the translated words will also be ALL CAPS."
  - qol: "Many more forms of punctuation are now conveyed across translations."
  - qol: "The 1000 most common English words will now never be scrambled when translating into other languages for the duration of the round. This means you can actually \"learn\" some words if you are especially attentive! (Until the next round at least)"
  - refactor: "Refactored language translations. Report if you see any super odd looking translations."
  - bugfix: "Force-says forcing you to speak common (such as cult invocations) will now correctly force you to speak common (even if you don't know common)"
