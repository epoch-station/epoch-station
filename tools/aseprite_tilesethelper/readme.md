# Info

## Dependencies

## Why?

The hardest thing to sprite at times down and upstream was walls and floor sprites reespectively, This aims to make life easier for those making those kinds of sprites. as no relevant tools or assistive systems could be found.

## I finished editing in aseprite, what next?

1. Export the file as a .PNG,
2. Make a new DMI file for your sprite
   2.1 Make sure your DMI file is enforcing 32x32
3. Import your image into the DMI file or Ctrl + C & Ctrl + V
4. Delete the Debug Break sprite and everything past it. (For new spriters, Sprite files are always left to right, Top Right to Bottom left.)

(Micro Example): The alphabet is the order it goes in.
A B C D
E F G H
I J K L

## There's colors I dont want!

Here's how to delete the unwanted colors

1. In the same DMI file as your imported sprites, go to the top left and click "Colors", then "Edit..."
2. Click on the colors you dont want, and press Delete (Backspace will not work)
